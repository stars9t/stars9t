# Welcome to my world, programmer!

ðŸ’»  I am currently working on a hidden project. Information coming soon...

ðŸŒ±  Now I am studying the C programming language. I study how the computer and other programming languages are tripled.

ðŸ‘¯ So far, I have not collaborated with other people, but if you would like to offer to help you with the project, you can contact me by mail wagner.alexander638@gmail.com

About me:
- I think programming is an interesting occupation, not a profession where you can get a lot of money.
- I love old tools like vim or emacs. I think the most convenient job is working in the terminal.
- I love music as it increases concentration.
- Now my setup consists of: vim, tmux, alacritty.
