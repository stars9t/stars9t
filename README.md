# Welcome to my world, programmer!

ðŸ’»  At the moment I have 2 small open projects. The first is a telegram bot with which you can get basic information on the characters from the LoL game. The second is a logging library for C

ðŸŒ±  At the moment I am studying C and C ++, as well as the internal structure of computer systems

About me:
- I think programming is an interesting occupation, not a profession where you can get a lot of money.
- I love old tools like vim or emacs. I think the most convenient job is working in the terminal.
- I love music as it increases concentration.
- Now my setup consists of: vim, tmux, alacritty.
